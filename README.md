# Powersharp
- A suite of tools for supporting an integrated approach to development with C#, PowerShell 7+, Typescript, M365, the MS Power Platform, and Azure
- Aims to simplify the journey between low-code, pro-code, and vibe-coding to speed up time-to-deployment using established Microsoft technologies, leveraging Microsoft development tools where possible, extending them intelligently where they can use it, and adding to them judiciously from non-Microsoft sources.
