## üìç Quick Overview

**PowerSharp Platform** is a unified monorepo containing tools for integrated development with C#, PowerShell 7+, TypeScript, M365, Power Platform, and Azure. The platform bridges low-code, pro-code, and AI-assisted development.

### Repository Structure
- **PowerSharp.Core** - Observability middleware for Microsoft Agent Framework
- **PowerSharp.Platform** - Foundation library
- **PowerSharp.Aspire** - .NET Aspire cloud-native stack (5 projects)
- **PnPSharp** - Unified PnP SDK + PowerShell hosting library (3 projects + samples/tests)

**Total:** 13 projects in `PowerSharp.Platform.sln`

### Git Status
- **Branch:** main
- **Last Commit:** Test infrastructure files pushed
- **Uncommitted Changes:** Yes (coverage configuration files ready to commit)
- **New Files:** coverlet.runsettings, Directory.Build.props, .coveragerc, RUN-COVERAGE.ps1

### Development Environment
- **Primary IDE:** VS Code (due to VS2022 stability issues)
- **Fallback IDE:** VS2022 (when stable)
- **.NET Version:** 9.0 (preview)
- **PowerShell:** 7.5+

---

## üöß Known Issues

### Critical
None currently

### Non-Critical
1. **File Lock on PowerSharp.Core.dll** (Windows Defender)
   - Impact: Build may fail intermittently
   - Workaround: Close apps, wait, rebuild
   - Status: Temporary runtime issue

2. **Git Tracking of Build Artifacts** (169 files)
   - Impact: Cluttered git status
   - Solution: Run `.\Cleanup-Git.ps1`
   - Status: Script ready, not executed yet

3. **VS2022 Crashes** (User reported)
   - Impact: Cannot use VS2022 reliably
   - Workaround: Use VS Code
   - Status: Ongoing, external issue

4. **Aspire Tests Require Docker**
   - Impact: Tests fail if Docker not running
   - Workaround: Start Docker Desktop before running tests
   - Status: Expected behavior for distributed app testing

## üìã Immediate Next Steps

### Priority 1: Complete CI/CD Configuration (Step 4)
```powershell
# Create GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing with coverage
# File: .github/workflows/dotnet-ci.yml
# - Run tests with xUnit
# - Collect coverage with coverlet
# - Generate HTML reports
# - Enforce threshold (60% minimum)
# - Upload artifacts
```

### Priority 2: Commit Coverage Configuration
```powershell
git add coverlet.runsettings Directory.Build.props .coveragerc RUN-COVERAGE.ps1
git add README.md .copilot-context.md
git commit -m "Add comprehensive code coverage configuration

- Created coverlet.runsettings with coverage thresholds
- Added Directory.Build.props with SourceLink support
- Documented coverage best practices in .coveragerc
- Added RUN-COVERAGE.ps1 automation script
- Updated README with testing documentation"
git push origin main
```

### Priority 3: Run Coverage Locally (Optional)
```powershell
# Test the coverage infrastructure
.\RUN-COVERAGE.ps1 -GenerateReport -Open

# Or run manually
dotnet test PowerSharp.Platform.sln --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage" --settings coverlet.runsettings
```

## ü§ù Session Handoff Notes

### For Next Session
1. **First action:** Review this file to understand current state
2. **Check git status:** Determine if integration was committed
3. **Verify build:** Ensure all projects still compile
4. **Check for new issues:** Review any errors or warnings
5. **Continue work:** Pick up from "Immediate Next Steps" section

### Context for AI Assistant
- User is working primarily in **VS Code** due to VS2022 crashes
- User prefers **PowerShell** for terminal commands
- Repository is in **active integration** phase (PnPSharp just integrated)
- Focus is on **stabilization** before moving to new features
- Documentation is a priority (comprehensive docs already created)

### Development Preferences
- **IDE:** VS Code preferred (VS2022 when stable)
- **Shell:** PowerShell 7+
- **Branch:** Working directly on `main` (single developer)
- **Commit Style:** Descriptive, organized commits
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive and up-to-date
